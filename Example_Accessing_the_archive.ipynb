Trade Mark. 13 FOSPHO GUANO, in ite natural state, is found on traip-rock islets within the tropics. It was dis- covered in 1854; and its existence made Inoown in August, 1856, by Dr VonLcCErR, at the Cheltenbam meeting of the British MAsociation for the Advancement of Science, when he read a pa~per \" On the Rtemarkeble Cornposition of a New Variety of Guano, railed Colombian or Maracaibo Guano,, pointing out its peculiar fitness as the base of a highly concentrated phosphatic manure. The valeablo and peouliar qealities of this manure, now vavll known as Poioespo GUANO, immediately attraeted the attention of the leading Agricultural Chemists, who pronounced it to be greatly superior to all other Guanos an a manurial agent. PiosPi\\'O GUANO contains, in ite natural state, nearly douhbe the quantity of phoephorie acid found in bones and ether sub- stances from which Superphosph.tee are prepared; and LEBiG states that by using PRossPRo GUANO the farmer conveys to his - field 26 per cent. more phesphoric acid than by a mixture of equal parts of Pbcuvian Guano and Superphosphate of Lime; while \"the advantage for the improved quality of tho soil appears still more in favour of the Peosomo GUANO, if the quantity of snolable phoephorie acid is takcen into consideration.\" One of the meet important advantages of the PH erTo GUANO Ti its uniform composition, and in this particular it is equalled by no other manure; for, with scarcely an exception, they all vary greatly in different samples, even when drawn from a com- paratively small bulk. The effect of the epplicationi of PHOSPHO5 GUANO to both Grain end Reot crope has borne out most truthfully and Satisfactorily thes character, given to it by Lecaro and VomLcmcaa. Whether used to asist the growth of Grain or Roots, or applied as a Top- dressing to Grass lands, it is found to produce, beyond all other manures, the greatest amount of the food-propertiesof the plant, and that with a marked seperierity of quality. The beneficial effect of the PsHOSPHD GUANO on the second and third year\\'s crepe ie also very marked; and in tb\\'s respect it ie unequalled. PHOSPiiO GUANO, being a very highly concentrated manure. requires, before being need, to be mixed with an equal weight of weed echos, sand or dry earth, so as to insure its eqeal distribution. Treated in thie way, it becomes the cheapest manure in t m . EXTRACT from REPORT of BARON LI IG, dated 11th Sept., 1863. Phoepho Guano surpasnes, most certaioly, by its more cerreet and constant composition, the hot sorts of Peruvian Guano; and of its snperior efficacy there can he niot the slightest doubt.\" Pamphlets, containing a full description of the PHlosrPO GUANO, its History, Nature, Properties, dcc., may be obtained on application. The Net Cash Price, including Bags, is £11 l0s per Ton, for TEN Tone and upwards, CARRIAGE FREE at any Railway Station or Shipping Port in the Kingdom. Smaller lots are charged higher.

Trade Mark. 13 FOSPHO GUANO, in ite natural state, is found on traip-rock islets within the tropics. It was dis- covered in 1854; and its existence made Inoown in August, 1856, by Dr VonLcCErR, at the Cheltenbam meeting of the British MAsociation for the Advancement of Science, when he read a pa~per \" On the Rtemarkeble Cornposition of a New Variety of Guano, railed Colombian or Maracaibo Guano,, pointing out its peculiar fitness as the base of a highly concentrated phosphatic manure. The valeablo and peouliar qealities of this manure, now vavll known as Poioespo GUANO, immediately attraeted the attention of the leading Agricultural Chemists, who pronounced it to be greatly superior to all other Guanos an a manurial agent. PiosPi\\'O GUANO contains, in ite natural state, nearly douhbe the quantity of phoephorie acid found in bones and ether sub- stances from which Superphosph.tee are prepared; and LEBiG states that by using PRossPRo GUANO the farmer conveys to his - field 26 per cent. more phesphoric acid than by a mixture of equal parts of Pbcuvian Guano and Superphosphate of Lime; while \"the advantage for the improved quality of tho soil appears still more in favour of the Peosomo GUANO, if the quantity of snolable phoephorie acid is takcen into consideration.\" One of the meet important advantages of the PH erTo GUANO Ti its uniform composition, and in this particular it is equalled by no other manure; for, with scarcely an exception, they all vary greatly in different samples, even when drawn from a com- paratively small bulk. The effect of the epplicationi of PHOSPHO5 GUANO to both Grain end Reot crope has borne out most truthfully and Satisfactorily thes character, given to it by Lecaro and VomLcmcaa. Whether used to asist the growth of Grain or Roots, or applied as a Top- dressing to Grass lands, it is found to produce, beyond all other manures, the greatest amount of the food-propertiesof the plant, and that with a marked seperierity of quality. The beneficial effect of the PsHOSPHD GUANO on the second and third year\\'s crepe ie also very marked; and in tb\\'s respect it ie unequalled. PHOSPiiO GUANO, being a very highly concentrated manure. requires, before being need, to be mixed with an equal weight of weed echos, sand or dry earth, so as to insure its eqeal distribution. Treated in thie way, it becomes the cheapest manure in t m . EXTRACT from REPORT of BARON LI IG, dated 11th Sept., 1863. Phoepho Guano surpasnes, most certaioly, by its more cerreet and constant composition, the hot sorts of Peruvian Guano; and of its snperior efficacy there can he niot the slightest doubt.\" Pamphlets, containing a full description of the PHlosrPO GUANO, its History, Nature, Properties, dcc., may be obtained on application. The Net Cash Price, including Bags, is £11 l0s per Ton, for TEN Tone and upwards, CARRIAGE FREE at any Railway Station or Shipping Port in the Kingdom. Smaller lots are charged higher.
